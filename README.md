# Statistics
This repository contains information on how some statistical methodology is implemented in data analysis.

In this project, some statistical processes in data analysis will be implemented on an Educational Dataset. The research was to find the districts where there is low literacy so that the government can apportion educational resources to those districts. During this project, the following statistical processes were implemented;

- Descriptive Statistics
- Probability Distributions (Normal Distribution, Empirical Rule, Z-scores)
- Sampling (Random Sampling, Central Limit Theorem, Sampling Distribution) 
- Confidence Intervals (Confidence interval, Confidence Level)
- Hypothesis Testing.
